## What We MUST Add

- **Create Profile**: Add profile (ensure they can edit profile and view order history).
- **Create Cart**: Edit existing product details (name, price, category).
- **Add Database for Adding Products to Cart**: There is only a database for inputing products on the site for right now.
- **Login Page**: Create a single login, make it simple (idc if it's hard coded tbh) and make sure it shows when it is invalid.
- **Sign Out and Back Button**: Make sure users can navigate between pages flawlessly without being stuck.

## Things We COULD Add

- **Dynamic Routing**: Products must be dynamically routed (if possible, but not necessary tbh).
- **Extra UI Stuff**: Extra stuff like student discount feature, enable user profile picture, fun effects, store logo in the header
